            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THe Lord <hi>Inchequin</hi> received a Letter from the Lord <hi>Taffe,</hi> Generall of the Iri≈øh Rebels about <hi>Mun≈øter,</hi> that he was now with an Army in the field; and would fight him, if he dur≈øt draw neere, with as many hundreds as he would.</p>
            <p>The Lord <hi>Inchequin</hi> returned him an≈øwer, that hee ≈øhould finde that he was not afraid to meet him in the field, and accordingly his Lord≈øhip joyned what ≈øtrength he could make to draw into the field again≈øt the Rebels (our men at that time were very low, and in much want of provi≈øions, ≈øhould they have laid ≈øtill and let the enemy de≈øtroy their quarters.</p>
            <p>The Lord <hi>Taffe</hi> marched with his Army neer <hi>Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo,</hi> and with him was joyned <hi>Alexander Magdonell,</hi> (commonly called <hi>Kilkittoth</hi>) who de≈øtroyed ≈øo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:161322:3"/>Prote≈øtants in <hi>Scotland:</hi> and with him a con≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable party of Red≈øhankes, and he was Lieutenant generall of the foot.</p>
            <p>The whole number of the Rebells Army were 7500. foot, and 1200. hor≈øe well armed, and a good trayne of Ammunition with them in the field, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching on to de≈øtroy our quarters in <hi>Mun≈øter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Lord <hi>Inchequin</hi> on Friday November 12. 1647. had notice where the Rebells Army was, and his Lord≈øhip having got together 4000. foot, and 1200. hor≈øes (all the ≈øtrength he could make, be≈øides tho≈øe that mu≈øt of nece≈ø≈øity be left to keep Garri≈øons) he marched towards the Rebells.</p>
            <p>On Saturday November 13. his Lord≈øhip di≈øco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered the Rebells near <hi>Mallo,</hi> and drew near to him.</p>
            <p>The Lord <hi>Inchequin</hi> ≈øent a challenge to the Lord <hi>Taffe</hi> (who was then on the top of a great hill, called <hi>Knocknegaoll,</hi> in Engli≈øh it is called the Engli≈øh-mans hill) to come downe from the hill, and he would, (though with a ≈ømaller number) fight with his whole Army: But the Lord <hi>Taffe</hi> returned an≈øwer, that hee was ≈øo much a ≈øouldier, that having gotten the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage he would keep it.</p>
            <p>Hereupon the Lord <hi>Inchequin</hi> moved towards the Rebells, front to front, to invite them to come down, but they would not ≈øtir.</p>
            <p>Then his Lord≈øhip withdrew parties to the other ≈øides of the hill, and ≈øent up ≈øeverall parties of Mu≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queteers to charge the Rebells, and at la≈øt got one part of the hill, and the wind ≈øide, but the Rebells, had routed one of our parties of foot on the other ≈øide of the hill, whom his Lord≈øhip with a re≈øerve (which he had ready) ≈øoone relieved, but wee lo≈øt at that time ≈øome 60. men.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:161322:3"/>
The Lord <hi>Taffe</hi> ≈øtill kept the hill, being confident to have de≈øtroyed all the Engli≈øh (upon a ≈øuper≈øtitious ob≈øervation of an old prophe≈øie that is in <hi>Ireland</hi> that an Engli≈øh-mans hill, (for ≈øo the place was called) <hi>Magdoneth</hi> ≈øhall much Engli≈øh blood ≈øpill. And this he attributed to him≈øelfe, becau≈øe that whereas it did formerly belong to <hi>Magdoneth</hi> it was now in his own hands, pre≈øuming that him≈øelfe ≈øhould be the man that ≈øhould then de≈øtroy the Engli≈øh; <hi>Alexander Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donel</hi> being then his Lieutenant generall, but ble≈ø≈øed be God, the Lord di≈øappointed their hopes.</p>
            <p>The Lord <hi>Inchequin</hi> (in this bu≈øine≈ø≈øe) deported him≈øelfe gallantly (and indeed we were in great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger that the Rebells would have compa≈ø≈øed our men round, there being no place of retreat for our men, yet God put ≈øuch a courage into our men, that there was a very great influence to performe their utmo≈øt again≈øt the Rebells.</p>
            <p>The de≈øpute by parties la≈øted ≈øome two howres, untill at la≈øt, the Rebells began by little and little to de≈øcend from the top of the hill, and then the fight was very fierce, but la≈øted not long, for in halfe an houre they were touted and broken. And no quarter was given to the Iri≈øh Rebells, nor to the Red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhankes.</p>
            <p>The Lord <hi>Inchequine</hi> charged many of quallity of the enemies party, among≈øt the re≈øt, one his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhip pur≈øued to a wood, and there ≈ølew him, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federate Officer; And his Lord≈øhip did ≈øo cut the Rogues that he brake his Sword into three peeces.</p>
            <p>We lo≈øt Collonell <hi>Gray</hi> and Major <hi>Browne,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther who fought gallantly, Sir <hi>Robert Trever,</hi> Judge <hi>Martiall</hi> was ≈ølaine neere our Carriages, (for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels

            <p>The whole number of the Rebels ≈ølaine were about 4000. many of which were killed in the pur≈øuite; and of our men were ≈ølaine about 120 in all, that is the mo≈øt we have lo≈øt.</p>
            <p>We have not taken many of the Common Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers pri≈øoners, for that would have hindred the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much, and be≈øides the Officers (according to the in clo≈øed li≈øt) were divers that e≈øcaped after they were taken, but tho≈øe which are expre≈øt in the Li≈øt are all ≈øecured pri≈øoners in cu≈øtody.</p>
            <p>The Lord <hi>Taffe</hi> him≈øelfe hardly e≈øcaped with ≈øome few others, and all tho≈øe who fled are di≈øper≈øed ≈øeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall wayes, ≈øo that it is beleived they will hardly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcape.</p>
